# Rapid-Miner-Processes-Practice
Here I have included Rapid Miner Processes for Various data mining algorithms. I have created them for practice purpose only...

This project is for Heart Disease Classification i.e. whether a person has a heart disease or not and this is done by using one of the most used dataset â€” Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Repository.

Steps of the project are :
  1. Cleaned the data
  2. Applying Model
  3. Model Testing
  4. Decision Tree Classification Algorithm
  5. Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm
